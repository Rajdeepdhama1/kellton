            About TNW
            TNW has been sharing, inventing and advancing tech developments since 2006. Here’s what you should know about us.
            
            History
            In 2006, founders Boris and Patrick were looking for a tech event to showcase their new startup. When they couldn’t find one that checked all the boxes they decided to host their own. As they were organizing things, they soon realized they needed somewhere to promote the conference, and that’s how thenextweb.com was launched. It later became a blog and the result is what you are looking at right now.
            
            TNW was started to bring insight, meaning—and every now and again, the lulz—to the world of technology. But we didn’t want to stop there. Today the company has grown from those two parts to four pillars that brought forth TNW News, TNW Deals, TNW Conference and Events, our new tech hub called TQ and Index, our market intelligence platform.
            Remarkable progress
                There’s a large and growing group of people who take a special interest in technology. This is what we call Generation T. Their need for information, data and personal connections is increasing.
